# New Research Methods for Neuroregeneration (Methods Only)

Selection Principles
- Novelty with plausible mechanistic route to regeneration/repair.
- Human relevance: uses human-derived models or translation-aware validation.
- Measurable outcomes with standardized, reproducible assays.
- Green-by-design: prioritize low-energy compute/lab flows and open protocols.

Categories and Exemplars
- High-throughput cellular perturbation
  - Multiplexed CRISPRi/a and base/prime-edit pooled screens in iPSC-derived neurons/glia with single-cell readouts (Perturb-seq, CRISPR-sci, CROP-seq).
  - Combinatorial perturbation mapping for axon growth and synaptogenesis.
- Spatial and single-cell multi-omics
  - Spatial transcriptomics + proteomics (Visium HD-scale; MIBI/IMC) for lesion microenvironments.
  - Single-cell long-read isoform profiling to capture neuroregeneration isoforms and splicing therapies.
- Live phenotyping platforms
  - Organoids/assembloids-on-chip with microfluidic gradients and multi-electrode arrays (MEA) for functional recovery metrics.
  - Microfluidic axotomy and axon guidance assays for regeneration kinetics at scale.
- Neuroimmune and scar microenvironment mapping
  - In situ barcoded lineage tracing (e.g., MEMOIR-style) of glia-to-neuron trajectories.
  - ECM remodeling assays (hydrogel mimetics) with real-time stiffness/ligand tuning.
- Connectomics-informed repair targets
  - Automated volume EM + machine learning pipelines to quantify synaptic reformation post-injury (sample-efficient models).
- Closed-loop stimulation as a method
  - Adaptive closed-loop spinal/brain/ultrasound neuromodulation as an experimental method to probe causal circuits aiding regeneration.
- Digital twins and causal inference
  - Patient-specific neuroregeneration digital twins combining biomarker time-series, imaging, and EHR; causal discovery to propose testable interventions.
- Federated and privacy-preserving analytics
  - Federated learning across hospitals with differential privacy and secure aggregation to learn recovery predictors without moving data.
- Lab automation with active learning
  - Robotic workflows coupled to Bayesian optimization to minimize experiments for discovering pro-regenerative factor cocktails.
- Protein/RNA design platforms
  - Sequence-to-function pipelines (diffusion/transformers) to design neurotrophic factors and targeted delivery peptides with off-target screens.
- Exosome/extracellular vesicle cargo discovery
  - High-throughput EV cargo screening (miRNA/protein) for axon growth; barcoded EV tracking in 3D tissues.
- Vascular and glymphatic repair methods
  - Microvascular network-on-chip platforms with shear stress control to co-optimize neurovascular regeneration.
- In vivo imaging and telemetry
  - Chronic calcium/voltage imaging in behaving models with closed-loop inference on recovery metrics; ultrasound localization microscopy for microvascular changes.
- Adaptive trials and N-of-1 frameworks (methods)
  - Bayesian adaptive platform trials tailored for early signal detection in regenerative interventions; digital consent and remote assessments.

Each submission should:
- Define the method's hypothesis and measurable endpoints.
- Provide a minimal validation plan (bench → preclinical → human-proximal data).
- Specify green ops plan (energy, reagent intensity, openness).
