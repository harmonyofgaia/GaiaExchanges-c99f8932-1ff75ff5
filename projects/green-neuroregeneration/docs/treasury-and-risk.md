# Treasury Policy & Risk Guardrails

Objectives
- Fund the annual methods award without jeopardizing long-term treasury health or token stability.
- Automatically adjust award size to background token mechanism and treasury conditions.

Definitions
- T_t: current treasury liquid value (stablecoin-equivalent).
- R_t: rolling 6–12 month average of treasury inflow − outflow (net rate).
- P_t: protocol token reference price index (smoothed).
- Runway_t: months of operating runway at current net spend.

Annual Award Calculation (safe envelope)
- BaseCap = k1 * EMA(T_t, 365d)
- RunwayCap = k2 * f(Runway_t) where f grows when Runway_t > target and shrinks otherwise.
- DrawCap = k3 * max(0, EMA(R_t, 180d))
- PriceDamp = clamp(P_t / EMA(P_t, 365d), floor=0.7, ceil=1.3)

- PriceStabilityFactor = clamp(P_t / EMA(P_t, 365d), floor=0.7, ceil=1.3)



Award_t = min(BaseCap, RunwayCap, DrawCap) * PriceDamp
Default k values:
- k1 = 0.01 (max 1% of average treasury)
- k2 = min(1.0, (Runway_t - 24) / target_runway)  # ensures runway remains ≥ 24 months post-award
- k3 = ≤ 20% of average positive net inflows

Guardrails
- Hard floor: treasury after award must keep ≥ 24 months runway.
- Circuit breaker: if R_t ≤ 0 for 2 consecutive quarters → no award.
- Price shock: if PriceDamp < PRICE_SHOCK_THRESHOLD → reduce Award_t by additional AWARD_REDUCTION_PERCENT.
- Multisig + community sign-off with transparent rationale.

Execution
- Proposal created with full inputs and backtests.
- Time-lock period (e.g., 7 days) before execution.
