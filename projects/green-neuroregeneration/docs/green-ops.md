# Green Operations

Compute
- Prefer small, efficient models; distillation and LoRA where applicable.
- Carbon-aware scheduling; track kgCO2e per training/inference.

Lab
- Reagent recycling and solvent minimization; life cycle analysis per assay.
- Open hardware where feasible; shared protocols to reduce duplication.

KPIs
- Energy per validated finding, reagent intensity, open access ratio.
