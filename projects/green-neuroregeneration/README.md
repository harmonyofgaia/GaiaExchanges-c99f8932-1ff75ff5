# ðŸ§  Green Neuroregeneration Initiative â€” Research Methods + Idea Alignment

Scope
- Only new research methods (discovery, validation, and translation-enabling methods) for neuroregeneration and neurorepair.
- Community matching, secure collaboration, live idea overview, voting, and treasury-integrated annual award.
- Integrates the same wallet model as other Green Investments projects.

Core Features
- Idea submission (methods-focused only) with structured templates.
- Matchmaking: semantic + constraints matching; auto-create an endâ€‘toâ€‘end encrypted (E2EE) chat room via "Habby Tycoon" Secure Chat (SSO deep link).
- Living Overview: searchable list of all methods and their docs; status and validation evidence.
- Voting & Annual Award: community voting with guardrails; yearly boost from the community vault; payout fluctuates with token mechanism while preserving treasury health.
- Wallet Integration: reuses the existing Green Investments wallet model for auth, voting, payouts, and identity safeguards.

Quick Start
1) Draft a method idea via GitHub Issues (New Research Method Proposal template).
2) Once submitted, the matching service suggests collaborators; accepted matches get a secure chat link.
3) Maintain your idea's folder under /projects/green-neuroregeneration/ideas/<slug>.
4) Participate in reviews and votes; the top-voted method annually receives a treasury boost (see governance).

Repo Layout (this subproject)
- ideas/_template â€” starter structure for an idea
- ideas/<slug> â€” each method's docs
- matches/ â€” metadata-only (no chat content)
- votes/ â€” vote receipts and tallies
