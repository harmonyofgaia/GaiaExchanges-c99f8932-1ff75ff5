Status: Proposal

## Executive summary
We propose a nature-aligned neuroregeneration track combining:
- Moringa (Moringa oleifera; "wonder tree") â€” rich in flavonoids and isothiocyanates (e.g., moringin) with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and potential neuroprotective actions.
- Blackberry (Rubus spp.) â€” abundant in anthocyanins and ellagitannins whose metabolites (e.g., urolithin A) support mitophagy, mitochondria, and neuroprotection.

Hypothesis: A standardized, high-bioavailability Moringa Ã— Blackberry formulation can synergistically reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, enhance neuronal survival and plasticity, and support myelination via complementary pathways and microbiome-mediated metabolites.

## Why Moringa
- Phytochemicals: quercetin, kaempferol, phenolic acids, vitamin C; glucosinolates/isothiocyanates (e.g., moringin).
- Mechanisms: Nrf2/ARE activation, NF-ÎºB modulation, mitochondrial support.
- Agro-ecology: drought-tolerant, fast-growing, multi-part utilization (leaves, pods, seeds).

## Why Blackberry
- Polyphenols: anthocyanins (e.g., cyanidin-3-glucoside), ellagitannins â†’ urolithins.
- Mechanisms: antioxidant/anti-inflammatory, BDNF/CREB signaling support, gutâ€“brain axis benefits.
- Agro-ecology: vigorous root systems; hedgerows enhance biodiversity and soils.

## Synergy rationale
- Complementary bioactives (isothiocyanates + anthocyanins/urolithins) cover oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial quality control, and synaptic plasticity.
- Bioavailability engineering (e.g., phytosomes, polysaccharide matrices) to improve stability and BBB penetration.
- Microbiome leverage: ellagitanninâ€“urolithin conversion plus Moringa fibers may modulate neuroinflammatory tone.

## Objectives
1. Standardize extracts with chemical fingerprints (HPLC/LCâ€“MS/MS).
2. Show in vitro efficacy across oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, synaptic function, myelination, mitochondria.
3. Demonstrate in vivo activity in at least two relevant neuro models.
4. Optimize formulation and PK/PD with BBB data.
5. Build a sustainable agronomic pipeline and traceability.
6. Define go-to-market (nutraceutical vs. preclinical candidate).

## Work plan (abridged)
- Phase 0: Literature + FTO scan; analytical SOPs; supplier prequalification.
- Phase 1: Extract engineering; in silico pathway/ADME/BBB modeling; candidate selection.
- Phase 2: In vitro neuro and safety assays (neurons, glia, OPCs; MEA; Nrf2/NF-ÎºB; mitophagy).
- Phase 3: In vivo proof-of-concept (neuroinflammation, demyelination, neurodegeneration models).
- Phase 4: Formulation and PK/BBB optimization.
- Phase 5: Human pilot (nutraceutical path) with safety and exploratory biomarkers.

## Quality, IP, and sustainability
- QC: multi-marker quantitation; batch variance â‰¤10% for key actives.
- Analytics: HPLC-DAD (anthocyanins), LCâ€“MS/MS (isothiocyanates/urolithins), TPC.
- IP: compositions (standardized ratios + delivery), methods-of-use, agronomic chemotypes.
- Cultivation: regenerative Moringa plots; Blackberry hedgerows; mycorrhizal partnerships; certifications and traceability.

## Initial markers
- Moringa: moringin, quercetin, kaempferol, chlorogenic acid, vitamin C.
- Blackberry: cyanidin-3-glucoside, ellagitannins; metabolite urolithin A.
- Pathways: Nrf2/ARE, NF-ÎºB, BDNF/CREB, mitophagy/biogenesis, microglial activation, myelination.

## Always-on research loop
- Continuous literature alerts and weekly triage.
- Centralized ELN and FAIR data; pre-registered protocols.
